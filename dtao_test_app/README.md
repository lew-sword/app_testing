# Macrocosmos dTao App
A lightweight app that can be used to demonstrate how python code can be displayed using streamlit

## Installation 
- Open the repo directory in terminal and then run 

    `python -m venv .venv`

- This will provide the necessary packages. As of writing this, bittensor dTao has now launced and version `9.0.0` is being used here.
- Activate the envrioment with 

    `source .venv/bin/activate`
  
- Run in terminal 

    `streamlit run macro_dtao_app.py` 

- The app should open in a new window and begin populating the data tables. The chart will take time to load due to bittensor rate limit.
